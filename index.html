<!--Hello maker! Welcome to my Electrate Fuego web design tutorial. I'm glad you found it--for this might be a really intersection on your way to becoming. I use this document in my Technical Communications classes at the University of Pittsburgh to teach my students a little bit about computer science. Just follow along and with comments like this, and you will make a really cool web documemt that not only introduces you to the other, but explains a little more about the discourse communities that have contributed to your arrival in this space, virtual and actual. 

You could do it the easy way like I once did: https://spark.adobe.com/page/umUY5ROHgANCl/ , or you can do a little more unconcealing...not just unconcealing who you are, but opening these tools that you use everyday, but might not know how they function, yet prove so necessary to how you (re)present yourself and connect with others in virtual spaces. And this last bit is an important point! If we really want to be makers, if we really want to be creative, then we need to really understand our tools and how they work. So let's cut it all open--using "tmesis" as the Ancient Greeks would call it...lets "cut" and arrange, tweak, take away and augment...that's how we create! 

In this doc., you will work through Gregory Ulmer's four discourses of family, entertainment, community, and schooling ((2002). Internet Invention From Literacy to Electracy.) Ulmer's theory of electracy helps makes sense of how we find/construct meaning and connect with others rhetorically in a media rich ecology. I hope you are excited to use this tool to create a document that will simultaneously help you process your journey and help orient you along the path on which you are headed in your becoming. I would like to give a shout-out to my research buddy Shauna Chung, who helped me develop the original Ulmerian framework we will be following in this document. Are you ready to get started?--> 
    
 <!--To get started, you will need to fork my repository from GitHub if you haven't already. If you want to easily publish it on GitHub, I'll give you more information at the end of this document. But for right now, fork, and then download the website to a zip file. Go ahead and put these files in a secure place (folder) where you will be able to find them and organize your other assests like images and pdf's, etcetera. You will also need a text editor like "brackets.io" or "notepad-plus-plus.org." Open the style.css and index.html documents in the text editor and we can get started building our own Electrate experience.--> 

<!--BTW. You can leave these faded comments be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--Go ahead and change the title of this HTML document from "Electrate Fuego" to whatever you want--><!--this other stuff below the title does important work to help tell different browsers what this page should look like on different screens-->

<!-- We'll need to do some more work in this section, but to do so, we will need to make some changes on your style.css file. developers refer to this division as a "Hero Block." You don't need to do anything on this html page, but you'll need to change the background image on the style.css page. Place a .jpg or .png in the same file folder (directory) as this project (hint: simplify the name). Change the other relevant information, especially if you're not John en Fuego or not majoring in "electracy"'--whatever that is?-->

<div class="par-centertext">
  <h2>My family is very important to where I am in life now. They have always been there to support me in my academic career and have pushed me to pursue my dreams. Initially, I wanted to go to trade school to save money, but my family pushed me to work hard and go to college because they felt I had enough potential to make something better of myself. I always liked working with robotics in high school and I knew that whenever I would participate in my clubs, my family was there to make sure I never gave up when I had failures and always pushed me to do my best work. I know that I can always depend on them to be there for me and I will always be there for them, because that is what family does for eachother. I am the middle child out of me and my five siblings, so I must set the precident and make a good example for them to follow. That is my job as a brother to teach them to always make sure family is first. It is important to recognize this because sometimes family is all we have, and without them life can become cumbersome and difficult.</h2></h2>

<!--Now we are moving into the kinds of media that contributes to your everyday discourse. This might sound weird, but Gregory Ulmer, who we discussed above, says that media has actually contributed a great deal to who you are as a person and how you language yourself. So, let's take some time to explore this discourse area. You will have some opportunities to add video content or other content. You might add an image (see the bottom of this sheet for directions on how to add elements) or perhaps add a photo grid like the one you did for "Family." Experiment. You can't break this thing!

  <h2>I do not know really what to write about here, so I will just talk about how much I enjoy sports. I am a very big hockey fan and growing up in Pittsburgh I have been able to witness the amazing Penguins win three Stanley Cup championships within my lifetime so far. I usually spend my time watching hockey to key down after a long day of work. If anyone is ever wondering what I do on my phone, I am not on snapchat, not on instagram, but instead I have my NHL app opened up, reading news and updates on everything in the league.</h2>

    <div class="par-centertext">

<!--So what exactly is you community. Is it actual? virtual? Where do find your ground, or at least, where do you drop anchor, you drifter, you? While we often think of communities as neighborhoods and clubs and colleagues, you might find community across the frontiers of the living, the dead, and perhaps those who have never lived. I'll let you explain-->
        
  <h2>I think the best example of my community is my home town of South Fayette. It is a small town where everyone knows everyone and nothing bad ever happens. If there is a major event almost everyone knows about it, and if you do not, well you must have been away on vacation. Although people might think you can create a "community" of people online, they cannot because it is nothing more than a group of strangers gathering who may never meet in their lifetime. Community to me is like a family, we do everything together, see everything together, and if we are not together when something happens, it will be told as a story during the next community event like a high school football game on a friday night. In a small town that is all we have and it is perfectly fine because everyone gets along and lives life to the fullest. I do feel it is possible to create a community online or anywhere in the world, but you have to make sure everyone familiarizes themselves with everyone or else the whole feeling of a community is gone. </h2>

  <h2>I went to school at South Fayette high school until my graduation in 2018. The school always held us to the highest standards and prepared us very well for our future ahead. I was and will be the academic one in my family. I was apart and ran most of the STEM organizations at my high school throughout my four years and my peers always felt that I was destined to be in engineering. Our teachers took pride in grading the hardest they possibly could to make us prepared for the harsh environment of college and it's reputation for weeding out those who are not cut out for their programs. I knew that after I completed my primary education, college would be easier for me considering all the tools and knowledge South Fayette gave to me, and I really do owe them because the skills I possess now were taught from a very young age. As it is known I study mechanical engineeering here at Pitt (or else I would not be writing this) and I am very glad I made the decision to go here. I feel that college here has pushed me to overcome many obstacles and at times made me struggle with topics that I thought I was a master in. It is fine though, because if I was always comfortable in what I am learning, then it would be just completing assignments and instead not learning from mistakes or wanting to learn more from struggles.</h2>

***Add an image. 
To add an image, all you need to do is add the HTML, the CSS style has aleady been set. Just drop the following code between other <div></div> elements...and you will need to replace the stinky feet.jpg.
